# OCAP – Decisions

This file records durable decisions only. Do not use it as a work log.

## 2026-09-16 – Separate technical memory from project cockpit

**Decision:** The repository is the technical source of truth for code-adjacent project memory. Notion is the human-facing project cockpit.

**Repository responsibilities:**
- current technical handoff in `docs/ocap/STATUS.md`;
- durable architecture/product decisions in this file;
- substantial audits and investigations under `docs/ocap/audits/`.

**Notion responsibilities:**
- concise project status;
- next steps;
- important decisions;
- links to repository, local project and relevant Obsidian context.

**Reason:** A new coding-agent session must be able to recover the technical state directly from the repository, while the user should not have to navigate code-oriented documentation to understand project progress.

## 2026-09-16 – Develop OCAP as an independent fork

**Decision:** Buttons Panel is the starting codebase, but OCAP will evolve as an independent product rather than trying to preserve routine upstream merge compatibility.

**Upstream policy:**
- keep Buttons Panel as a reference source;
- review important upstream releases and commits;
- selectively port useful fixes or ideas into OCAP;
- do not treat automatic upstream merging as a design constraint.

**Reason:** The initial audit found no stable extension API for the core features OCAP needs. Context-aware visibility, settings migrations, dynamic rendering, action-registry cleanup and future component extensibility all require changes in actively changing core files. Preserving merge compatibility would therefore constrain the same areas that need architectural improvement.

## 2026-09-16 – Stabilize before adding the Context Engine

**Decision:** Do not build the first OCAP context feature directly on the audited baseline. First create a minimal automated test safety net and fix the highest-confidence baseline defects.

**Initial stabilization scope:**
- React hook-order defects in `NavigationBar` and `FolderModeContent`;
- stale-render risk in `ButtonItem` memoization;
- unsafe metadata evaluation in `ScriptService.getScriptMeta`;
- exact pinning of fragile dnd-kit dependencies;
- controlled removal of clearly dead code;
- baseline verification through install/lint/typecheck/build where appropriate.

**Reason:** The upstream code has no automated tests and the most fragile areas overlap with the architecture OCAP will extend.

## 2026-09-16 – Vitest as the unit-test foundation

**Decision:** Unit tests run on Vitest (3.x) with a Node environment, tests under `tests/`, and a minimal `obsidian` module mock (`tests/mocks/obsidian.ts`) wired via resolve alias. No browser/E2E infrastructure in this phase.

**Reason:** The project is esbuild-based ESM TypeScript; Vitest executes it natively with near-zero configuration and stays fast. Services and pure logic (later: Context Engine, condition resolver) are testable without a full Obsidian app. Vitest 5 currently conflicts with the build's pinned esbuild 0.25.5 (its Vite 8 requires esbuild ≥0.27 as peer); revisit the major upgrade together with a deliberate esbuild upgrade.

## 2026-09-16 – Object identity signals content change for memoized React components

**Decision:** Settings objects (`ButtonConfig`, `CategoryConfig`) shared between React and `plugin.settings` are treated as immutable-per-edit: code that changes an object's content must replace it with a new object (as `ButtonEditModal` now does). React memo comparators compare these props by identity (`shallowEqualExcept`), never by deep value.

**Reason:** Prop-based value comparison can never detect in-place mutation (prev and next props read the same object), and deep equality across replaced objects would keep stale identities captured in event handlers. Identity comparison is only correct if edits produce new identities — this contract must be preserved by future edit paths.

## Open decisions

The following are still open:

- final Context Engine design;
- final declarative condition/rule model;
- final dynamic-component extension API;
- test coverage targets and component/UI testing approach (unit-test stack is decided: Vitest);
- packaging and release strategy for OCAP;
- final OCAP manifest `id` and public product naming details.
